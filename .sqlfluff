# Rules reference: https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/rules.html#rules-reference
# AL01 Implicit/explicit aliasing of table.
# AL02 Implicit/explicit aliasing of columns.
# AL03 Column expression without alias. Use explicit AS clause.
# AL04 Table aliases should be unique within each clause.
# AL05 Tables should not be aliased if that alias is not used.
# AM01 Ambiguous use of DISTINCT in a SELECT statement with GROUP BY.
# AM02 UNION [DISTINCT|ALL] is preferred over just UNION.
# AM03 Ambiguous ordering directions for columns in order by clause.
# AM05 Join clauses should be fully qualified.
# AM06 Inconsistent column references in GROUP BY/ORDER BY clauses.
# CP01 Inconsistent capitalisation of keywords.
# CP02 Inconsistent capitalisation of unquoted identifiers.
# CP03 Inconsistent capitalisation of function names.
# CP04 Inconsistent capitalisation of boolean/null literal.
# CP05 Inconsistent capitalisation of datatypes.
# CV01 Use != instead of <> for “not equal to” comparisons.
# CV02 Use COALESCE instead of IFNULL or NVL.
# CV03 Trailing commas within select clause.
# CV05 Comparisons with NULL should use “IS” or “IS NOT".
# CV07 Top-level statements should not be wrapped in brackets.
# CV08 Use LEFT JOIN instead of RIGHT JOIN.
# JJ01 Jinja tags should have a single whitespace on either side.
# LT01 Excessive whitespace, trailing whitespace.
# LT02 Incorrect indentation.
# LT03 Operators should follow a standard for being after newlines.
# LT04 Leading comma enforcement
# LT06 Function name must be immediately followed by parenthesis.
# LT07 WITH clause closing bracket should be on a new line.
# LT08 Blank line expected but not found after CTE closing bracket.
# LT09 Select targets should be on a new line unless there is only one select target.
# LT10 SELECT modifiers (e.g. DISTINCT) must be on the same line as SELECT.
# LT11 Set operators should be surrounded by newlines.
# LT12 Files must end with a single trailing newline.
# LT13 Files must not begin with newlines or whitespace.
# RF01 References cannot reference objects not present in FROM clause.
# RF02 References should be qualified if select has more than one referenced table/view.
# RF03 References should be consistent in statements with a single table.
# ST01 Do not specify else null in a case when statement (redundant).
# ST02 Unnecessary CASE statement.
# ST03 Query defines a CTE (common-table expression) but does not use it.
